## 📋 Overview

The **Smart AI Reasoning System** is an advanced problem-solving AI that combines multiple reasoning strategies to provide accurate, confident answers. Built with **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, it uses **Tree-of-Thought** and **Self-Consistency** approaches to think through problems from multiple angles, then intelligently combines the results.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Reasoning
- **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)**: 5 distinct reasoning approaches (Analytical, Intuitive, Systematic, Creative, Verification)
- **Self-Consistency**: Multiple solution attempts with majority voting
- **Smart Arbitration**: Uses AI to resolve conflicts between approaches

### 🔧 Auto-Optimization System
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously evaluates answer quality
- **Failure Detection**: Identifies low confidence and poor answers
- **Automatic Improvement**: Generates better prompts when issues detected
- **A/B Testing**: Validates improvements before deployment

### 📊 Supported Problem Types
- **📊 Math**: Calculations, word problems, equations
- **🧩 Logic**: Reasoning puzzles, logical deduction
- **🐛 Code**: Debugging, programming concepts
- **🌟 General**: Any question or analysis task

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system processes problems through two main strategies:

1. **Tree-of-Thought Strategy**: Uses 5 different reasoning approaches to solve the same problem
2. **Self-Consistency Strategy**: Generates multiple solutions and finds consensus

The results are then combined using intelligent arbitration to produce the final answer with confidence scoring.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Gemini API Key
- Internet Connection

### Quick Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`
3. Set up your Gemini API key as environment variable
4. Run `demo.py` to start the interactive system

## 🎯 Usage

The system provides both interactive and programmatic interfaces:

- **Interactive Mode**: Run the demo for guided problem solving
- **Programmatic API**: Import the reasoning engine for custom applications
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple problems simultaneously

## 🔧 How It Works

### Problem Solving Process
1. **Input Analysis**: System identifies problem type and context
2. **Multi-Path Reasoning**: Applies both ToT and Self-Consistency strategies
3. **Result Combination**: Intelligently merges outputs from different approaches
4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates confidence and triggers optimization if needed

### Auto-Optimization
The system continuously monitors its performance and automatically improves when issues are detected:
- Tracks answer quality and confidence scores
- Identifies patterns in failures
- Generates improved prompts using AI
- Tests and deploys better versions automatically
