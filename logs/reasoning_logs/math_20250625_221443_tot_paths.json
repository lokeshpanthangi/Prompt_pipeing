Each part represents 120/4 = 30. Therefore, 25% of 120 is 30. This method relies on a strong visual understanding of fractions and avoids direct percentage calculations.\n\n**2.  The Doubling and Halving Dance:**\n\n* **Halving:** 50% of 120 is 60 (120/2).\n* **Halving Again:** 25% is half of 50%, so half of 60 is 30.\n\nThis method uses a sequential approach, breaking down the percentage into easily manageable steps. It leverages the inherent relationship between percentages and their halves.\n\n**3.  The \"Percent as a Rate\" Approach:**\n\nThink of 25% as a rate of change. If something increases by 25%, it becomes 125% of its original value.  Conversely, if something *decreases* by 25%, it becomes 75% of its original value.  We can use this to work backwards.  Let's say 'x' is 25% of 120.  Then 120 - x = 75% of 120.  This leads us to a slightly more complex equation, but it showcases a different perspective on percentages.  Solving this equation (120 - x = 0.75 * 120) will also yield x = 30.\n\n**4.  The Proportional Reasoning Story:**\n\nLet's say you have 120 apples and you want to give away 25% to your friends.  You could divide the apples into four equal piles (representing the four quarters).  Each pile has 30 apples, and that's what you give away.  This uses a relatable scenario to make the percentage problem more concrete and easier to grasp.\n\n\n**5.  The Unit Rate Method:**\n\nFind 1% of 120 first. This is 120/100 = 1.2.  Then multiply by 25 to get 25% (1.2 * 25 = 30). This is a less intuitive but mathematically sound approach, useful for percentages that aren't easily divisible fractions.\n\n\nThese creative approaches highlight that there's more than one path to the correct answer.  They emphasize understanding the underlying concepts of percentages rather than just memorizing formulas.  The best approach depends on individual preferences and the context of the problem.\n",

I can break it down:\n\n* 120 divided by 2 is 60.\n* 60 divided by 2 is 30.\n\nTherefore, 25% of 120 is $\\boxed{30}$.\n\nThis feels right because 30 is a reasonable fraction of 120; it's significantly less than half (60), but not insignificant.  A quick check:  30 is less than half of 120, and 30 x 4 = 120, confirming it's a quarter.\n",
