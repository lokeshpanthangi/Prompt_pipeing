Decomposition and Recomposition:**\n\n* **Breaking it down:**  Instead of adding directly, we can decompose 100 into 5 and 95.  Adding 5 to 995 gives us 1000, and adding the remaining 95 gives us 1095.  This leverages easier additions.\n\n* **Rounding and Adjustment:**  Round 995 up to 1000.  This requires adding 5.
