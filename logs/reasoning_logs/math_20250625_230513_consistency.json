      "response": "The problem statement \"what is the value of 995 root 75 plus 09475\" is ambiguous.  It's unclear whether \"995 root 75\" means 995 * \u221a75 or (995\u221a75).  We'll solve both interpretations.\n\n**Interpretation 1: 995 * \u221a75 + 09475**\n\n1. **Read the problem carefully:** We need to calculate the product of 995 and the square root of 75, and then add 9475 (09475 is just 9475 with a leading zero).\n\n2. **Identify what information is given and what needs to be found:**  We are given the numbers 995, 75, and 9475. We need to find the value of 995 * \u221a75 + 9475.\n\n3. **Show all calculations clearly:**\n\n   * First, calculate the square root of 75: \u221a75 \u2248 8.660\n   * Next, multiply 995 by the square root of 75: 995 * 8.660 \u2248 8632.7\n   * Finally, add 9475: 8632.7 + 9475 = 18107.7\n\n4. **State your final answer clearly:** The value of 995 * \u221a75 + 9475 is approximately 18107.7\n\n\n**Interpretation 2: (995\u221a75) + 09475**\n\nThis interpretation is less likely given the phrasing, but it's mathematically possible.  It would mean the square root applies to the product of 995 and 75.\n\n1. **Read the problem carefully:** We need to calculate the square root of (995 * 75), then add 9475.\n\n2. **Identify what information is given and what needs to be found:** We are given the numbers 995, 75, and 9475.  We need to find the value of \u221a(995 * 75) + 9475.\n\n3. **Show all calculations clearly:**\n\n   * First, multiply 995 and 75: 995 * 75 = 74625\n   * Next, calculate the square root: \u221a74625 \u2248 273.17\n   * Finally, add 9475: 273.17 + 9475 = 9748.17\n\n4. **State your final answer clearly:** The value of \u221a(995 * 75) + 9475 is approximately 9748.17\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDue to the ambiguity of the problem statement, there are two possible answers:  approximately **18107.7** or approximately **9748.17**.  The first interpretation (995 * \u221a75 + 9475) is more probable given standard mathematical notation.  Clearer mathematical notation is crucial to avoid such ambiguity.\n",
